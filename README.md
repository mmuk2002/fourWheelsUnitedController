# Four Wheels Controller

### When to turn on the controller
Our controller can be turned on when traveling around 15 m/s (around 30 mph) and with a lead distance of between 110-150 meters. This speed and lead distance combination will ensure that you start in the "slow" acceleration block. In this block with these speeds and lead distances, you should begin accelerating between 0.40-0.80 m/s^2.
